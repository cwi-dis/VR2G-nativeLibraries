# VR2G-nativeLibraries

Repository with VR2Gather submodule that stores native binary DLLs.

The package itself is in the subdirectory `nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather.nativelibraries`.

Add to Unity by using Package Manager -> Add Git URL and then using URL `git+https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2G-nativeLibraries?path=/nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather.nativelibraries`.

## Maintainance

There is a script in `.build` tht may help collecting the DLLs to package for Windows.
